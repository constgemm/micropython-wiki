The Timers can be cascaded to make more complex timing relationships, or longer periods.
Internally only some timers can trigger others. This is a Master/Slave relationship and is handled by the SMS register.

For example, you can see below that TIM8 can be triggerd by TIM1.

* One Timer can be used as the prescaler for another.
* The first timer update_event, or output_compare signal is used as clock for the second.
* Uses TRGI to map.
* Counter mode is set using the TIMx_CR1 reg and CMS bits as indicated in the example below.
* The counter mode sets whether the update_event occurs on overflow and/or underflow of the Timer.

###Example for internal trigger
Internal trigger clock mode 1 (ITRx)
TIM_CLK is replaced by ITRx_CLK which is the internal trigger freq mapped to timer Trigger input TRGI.

The counter mode indicates if the update_event is generated:
* on overflow - if mode = up counting, the DIR bit is reset in TIMx_CR1
* on underlfow - if mode = down counting, the DIR bit is set in TIMx_CR1
* both - if mode is center aligned, the CMS bits are non zero

The update_event is also generated by:
* software if the UG bit (Update Generation) is set in TIM_EGR reg.
* update generation through the slave mode controller
