### Overview
There are 10 Timers on the STM32F405 chip being used by the mircropython KS project. Not all Timers have pins allocated to them on this 64 pin package. (The 407 based chipsets have the same allocation of timers.)
Timers in this chipset come with various capabilities:
* TIM1 and TIM8 are advanced 16 bit timers and can count up and down. They can be used to drive steppers or 3 phase motors. They have special trigger and brake input pins to support this. They are the only timers with pinouts defined for complementary outputs. I.e. they can drive three channels of two pins up and down in perfect synchronisation. They are capable of driving 4 channels for output.
* TIM2 and TIM5 are 32 bit Timers. TIM2 can be triggered by an external signal. Both TIM2 and 5 have 4 channels.
* TIM3 and TIM4 are 16 bit timers. Both have 4 channels but TIM3 has more pins allocated.
* TIM9 and TIM12 are 2 channel timers. Only TIM9 has pins.
* TIM10 and TIM11 have a single output channel each.
* The remaining Timers 6,7,13,14 do not have any pin connections on the 64 pin package.
All timers can be used to generate timebases. Most can do PWM generation. A digram below shows how timers can be cascaded to make longer or triggered timings. Most triggers can also generate Interrupts.

The following timers can sample an input signal and determine its period. `1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11

These Timers can be used to correctly determine speed and direction from externally supplied quadrature signals. `1,2,3,4,5,8,9
